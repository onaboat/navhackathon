# Promoting User Participation and Awareness of Proposals within a DAO

One of the primary challenges many Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) face is ensuring active participation from its members. Voting on proposals is crucial, as these decisions shape the direction and actions of the DAO. To bolster this, an efficient method of keeping members informed about new proposals and motivating them to vote is essential.

## Integrating DAO Proposal Alerts with MetaMask

A practical solution to this challenge is to integrate DAO proposal alerts into users' **MetaMask snaps**. This ensures that members are instantly notified of any new proposals from their MetaMask wallet. This method is simple, efficient, and streamlines the voting process, making it more likely for members to participate actively.

For the purpose of this guide, we'll use the 'onaboatatsea.eth' space as an example. However, Snapshot offers numerous spaces, and the same process can be replicated for any other space within the platform.

Integrate these alerts directly into your **MetaMask snaps**. By doing so, every time a new proposal is up for voting, you'll receive a notification directly in your MetaMask wallet, streamlining the voting process.

Once alerted, users can click on the notification with all the details, including a link to the respective proposal on Snapshot. This simplifies the voting process, making it more likely for members to participate actively.

## Conclusion

By integrating DAO proposal alerts into **MetaMask snaps**, members are given a seamless experience that keeps them informed and encourages active participation. As demonstrated with 'onaboatatsea.eth', this method is versatile and can be extended to any space within Snapshot, making it an invaluable tool for all DAOs aiming to foster a thriving, participative community.
